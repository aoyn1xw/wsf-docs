## Important Tips

- **Avoid VPN**: Do not set up a VPN unless absolutely necessary. If you need a VPN, delete the apps, set up the VPN, and then reinstall the apps.
- **Single Configuration File**: Do not install multiple configuration files. Stick to one DNS provider to avoid conflicts.
- **Device Care**: Keep your device alive and avoid letting the battery completely die to prevent potential issues with certificate validation.
