## Steps to Install the Certificate

1. **Visit the Website**:
   - Go to the website providing the enterprise certificates.
   - Click on the "Downloads" section.
2. **Access the Portal**:
   - In the downloads section, find and click on "Portal". This is an in-house app currently under maintenance.
   - Note: The Portal app might have some broken features, so it's recommended to upload your own `.ipa` file for a better experience.
3. **Upload and Install **`.ipa`** File**:
   - You can find `.ipa` files on GitHub or other decrypted sources. Upload the `.ipa` file to the Portal.
   - Install the `.ipa` file without any 3-day or 7-day app limits.
4. **Enable DNS**:
   - Ensure that DNS is constantly enabled. If the DNS gets overwritten, your device will be blacklisted, meaning you won't be able to use the certificate anymore.
