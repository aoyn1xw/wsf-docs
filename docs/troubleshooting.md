## Troubleshooting

- **App Suddenly Stops Working**: If an app stops working or requires an internet connection despite being connected, it likely means you are about to be blacklisted. And its recommended to switch to a diffrent certificate (if all of them dont work i recommmend you use altstore/sidestore or buy a certifcate)
