# Post-Install Rules

Post-installation rules ensure your system is properly configured and secure after the initial setup. These automated and manual procedures help maintain system integrity and optimal performance.

## Automated Post-Install Rules

The system automatically executes several rules after installation to ensure proper configuration:

### Security Hardening

Automatic security configurations include:

1. **Default Password Changes**: Force users to change default passwords
2. **Firewall Configuration**: Enable and configure basic firewall rules
3. **SSL/TLS Setup**: Install and configure secure communication certificates
4. **User Account Policies**: Set password complexity and expiration rules
5. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive system logging

### System Optimization

Performance optimization rules:

- Database indexing and optimization
- Cache configuration and sizing
- Memory allocation adjustments
- Network buffer optimization
- Disk I/O performance tuning

## Manual Configuration Tasks

### Network Configuration

Complete these network setup tasks:

1. **DNS Configuration**
   - Set primary and secondary DNS servers
   - Configure domain search paths
   - Test DNS resolution

2. **Network Time Protocol (NTP)**
   - Configure NTP servers
   - Set timezone correctly
   - Verify time synchronization

3. **Proxy Settings**
   - Configure HTTP/HTTPS proxy if required
   - Set proxy authentication credentials
   - Test internet connectivity

### Backup Configuration

Set up comprehensive backup procedures:

1. **Backup Destinations**
   - Configure local backup storage
   - Set up remote backup locations
   - Test backup connectivity

2. **Backup Schedules**
   - Daily incremental backups
   - Weekly full system backups
   - Monthly archive backups

3. **Backup Verification**
   - Automated backup testing
   - Restore procedure validation
   - Backup integrity checking

## Security Compliance Rules

### Access Control Validation

Verify proper access controls are in place:

1. Review default user permissions
2. Validate administrator account settings
3. Test service account configurations
4. Verify file and directory permissions
5. Check database access controls

### Encryption Standards

Ensure all data is properly encrypted:

- **Data at Rest**: Database and file encryption
- **Data in Transit**: Network communication encryption
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation
- **Certificate Validation**: Verify all certificates are properly installed

## Monitoring and Alerting Setup

### System Monitoring

Configure comprehensive system monitoring:

1. **Resource Monitoring**
   - CPU utilization thresholds
   - Memory usage alerts
   - Disk space monitoring
   - Network performance tracking

2. **Application Monitoring**
   - Service availability checks
   - Response time monitoring
   - Error rate tracking
   - User session monitoring

### Alert Configuration

Set up appropriate alerting mechanisms:

- Email notifications for critical events
- SMS alerts for emergency situations
- Dashboard alerts for real-time monitoring
- Log aggregation and analysis
