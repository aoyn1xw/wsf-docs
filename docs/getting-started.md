# Getting Started with WSF

This guide walks you through the process of installing and using enterprise certificates on iOS devices for various purposes such as privacy, development, and more. We are using publicly shared enterprise certificates, so no new certificates are being distributed.

## Prerequisites

- An iOS device running iOS 10 or later.
- Access to a DNS box server for validation.

## Types of Revocation

- **Blacklist**: You are banned from using the certificate.
- **Revoke**: Apple has taken action against the certificate, rendering it invalid.
