# Certificates

Certificate management is crucial for maintaining secure communications and ensuring proper authentication across the platform.

## Certificate Overview

Our platform supports various types of digital certificates for different security purposes, including SSL/TLS certificates, client authentication certificates, and signing certificates.

### Supported Certificate Types

- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: For secure web communications
- **Client Authentication**: For user identity verification
- **Code Signing**: For application and update verification
- **Email Certificates**: For secure email communications

## Installing Certificates

### Automatic Installation

For supported certificate authorities, use the automatic installation process:

1. Navigate to **Security â†’ Certificate Management**
2. Click **Install New Certificate**
3. Select **Automatic Installation**
4. Enter your certificate authority credentials
5. Choose the certificate type and validity period
6. Click **Install** and wait for confirmation

### Manual Installation

For custom or third-party certificates:

1. Obtain the certificate file (usually `.crt`, `.pem`, or `.p12`)
2. Access the certificate management interface
3. Select **Manual Installation**
4. Upload the certificate file
5. Provide the private key if required
6. Enter the certificate password if applicable
7. Configure certificate binding and applications
8. Test the certificate installation

## Certificate Configuration

### Certificate Binding

Bind certificates to specific services and applications:

- **Web Services**: Assign SSL certificates to web applications
- **Email Services**: Configure certificates for email encryption
- **API Endpoints**: Secure API communications
- **Database Connections**: Encrypt database communications

### Certificate Chain Validation

Ensure proper certificate chain configuration:

1. Verify the root certificate authority is trusted
2. Check intermediate certificates are properly installed
3. Validate the certificate chain order
4. Test certificate validation with external tools

## Certificate Renewal

### Automatic Renewal

Set up automatic certificate renewal to prevent expiration:

1. Enable auto-renewal in certificate settings
2. Configure renewal timing (recommended: 30 days before expiration)
3. Set up notification preferences
4. Test the renewal process with a staging certificate

### Manual Renewal Process

For manual certificate renewal:

1. Generate a new certificate signing request (CSR)
2. Submit the CSR to your certificate authority
3. Download the new certificate
4. Install the new certificate using the same process as initial installation
5. Update all applications and services using the certificate
6. Remove the old certificate after verifying the new one works

## Certificate Monitoring

### Expiration Tracking

Monitor certificate expiration dates:

- View all certificates and their expiration dates
- Set up email notifications for upcoming expirations
- Configure dashboard alerts for certificates expiring soon
- Generate reports on certificate status

### Certificate Health Checks

Regular health checks ensure certificates are functioning properly:

- Automated validation of certificate chains
- Checking for revoked certificates
- Monitoring certificate usage and performance
- Alerting on certificate-related errors

## Troubleshooting Certificates

### Common Issues

- **Certificate not trusted**: Check if the root CA is installed
- **Wrong certificate for domain**: Verify subject alternative names
- **Certificate expired**: Renew or replace the certificate
- **Private key mismatch**: Ensure the private key matches the certificate

### Validation Tools

Use these commands to validate certificates:

```bash
# Check certificate details
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout

# Verify certificate chain
openssl verify -CAfile ca-bundle.crt certificate.crt

# Test SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect domain.com:443
```
